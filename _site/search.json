    "text": "Setting up APA 7 in papaja\npapaja is an R package for preparing APA-styled articles in Rmarkdown. It’s current version (0.1.2) supports APA 6 guidelines, although the newest guidelines are APA 7. Basically, we need to get papaja to use APA 7.\nI achieved this by following these steps:\n\nInstall developer version of papaja:\n\n\nremotes::install_github(\"crsh/papaja@devel\")\n\n\nAdd to the YAML:\n\n\ncsl               : \"`r system.file('rmd', 'apa7.csl', package = 'papaja')`\"\ndocumentclass     : \"apa7\"\n\nAnd this:\n\nheader-includes:\n  - |\n    \\makeatletter\n    \\renewcommand{\\paragraph}{\\@startsection{paragraph}{4}{\\parindent}%\n      {0\\baselineskip \\@plus 0.2ex \\@minus 0.2ex}%\n      {-1em}%\n      {\\normalfont\\normalsize\\bfseries\\typesectitle}}\n    \n    \\renewcommand{\\subparagraph}[1]{\\@startsection{subparagraph}{5}{1em}%\n      {0\\baselineskip \\@plus 0.2ex \\@minus 0.2ex}%\n      {-\\z@\\relax}%\n      {\\normalfont\\normalsize\\bfseries\\itshape\\hspace{\\parindent}{#1}\\textit{\\addperi}}{\\relax}}\n    \\makeatother\n\nThis was sufficient for my set-up.

    "text": "Testing\nTo test if APA 7 vs. 6 was being used, I changed a BibTex entry for a reference to have more than 7 authors (e.g., by repeating all the author names until &gt;7). I then changed csl: \"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/library/papaja/rmd/apa7.csl\" to csl: \"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/library/papaja/rmd/apa6.csl\". In the bibliography only 7 authors were listed (following apa 6). I then changed it back to 'apa7.csl, and the rendered bibliography listed all authors (following apa 7). I took this as sufficient evidence that apa 7 was indeed being used. I then changed the BibTex authors back, of course."

    "text": "It feels strange to be starting a blog dedicated to (lingusitic) data analysis, as like most linguists I’m essentially self-taught in R in that the courses that were offered during my studies did not take me quite as far as I needed to go. As I understand it, this is not something unique to linguistics. As noted in Lawlor et al. (2022) (a highly recommended read), Emery et al. (2021) reported that the vast majority of life science educators surveyed rated data skills as highly important for students, and yet only about half of respondents indicated that such skills were likely to be learned in required or even elective courses, with ‘Course in another department’ receiving the highest overall likelihood rating. I believe we are in a similar situation in the language sciences: For students and researchers to be successful and competitive candidates for future positions/study programs, data skills are important, but they’re not so important that we expect our students will be learning them to satisfaction in our departments? The call is coming from inside the house…\nI say all this as a former linguistics student myself. I see myself in my current students and peers. We started studying linguistics because of the humanities aspect of the field: understanding language, dissecting and developing language theory, observing and describing language patterns and differences between speakers and speaker communities. The last thing we were thinking about was math and computer science, but alas, here I find myself starting a blog on just that topic (or at least a sub-topic). And so, here is one of my intentions for 2024: regularly write mini-tutorials in this blog to (a) help students/peers, (b) map out topics for courses, workshops, or single lectures, and (c) remind future-me how I did something. Though reason (a) might seem totally selfless, when you consider my current position includes teaching and consulting on similar topics, this actually will lighten my workload in the long run, as I won’t have to provide consultations on the same problem over and over again! Reasons (b) and (c) are also pretty self-serving in that they’ll simplify my workflow and productivity. So in conclusion, I’m creating this blog for totally selfish reasons, namely to make my own life easier, and if it helps others in the long run that’s just icing on the cake.\nTo selfishly helping others in 2024, and Auld Lang Syne!\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nEmery, N.
